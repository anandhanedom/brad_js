**************** CHAPTER 1 ****************

* if/else statements allow you to make decisions in your code.

* while/for statements allow you to execute code many times by looping.

**************** CHAPTER 2 ****************

* JavaScript is 'pass-by-value'.

* #1: what happens when we don’t pass enough arguments? Undefined for missing args.
  #2: what happens when we pass too many argments? Extra args ignored.
  #3: what happens when we have NO parameters? No worries.

* If a variable is declared outside a function, it’s 'GLOBAL'.
  If it’s declared inside a function, it’s 'LOCAL'.
  'GLOBAL' can be shadowed by 'LOCAL'.

**************** CHAPTER 4 ****************

* Assigning a value to an item that doesn’t exist in the array will create a new
  item in the array.

* The 'while' loop is most often used when you don’t know how many times you need
  to loop, and you’re looping until a condition is met. 
  
* The 'for' loop is most often used when you know the number of times the loop needs
  to execute. 

**************** CHAPTER 5 ****************

* To delete a property: 'delete'. Eg. delete person.name
* A 'primitive variable' represents the actual value of the variable while an 'object  
  variable' represents a way to get to the object.
